  <h2> <b> What is hadoop ? </b></h2> <br>
  <p>Apache Hadoop is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitates using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation. It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model. </p> <br>
  <h2><b> What is Hadoop Cluster ? </b></h2> <br>
  <p> A Hadoop cluster is nothing but a group of computers connected together via LAN. We use it for storing and processing large data sets. Hadoop clusters have a number of commodity hardware connected together. They communicate with a high-end machine which acts as a master. These master and slaves implement distributed computing over distributed data storage. It runs open source software for providing distributed functionality. </p> <br>
  <h2> <b> Master in Hadoop Cluster: </b></h2>
  <br> <p> It is a machine with a good configuration of memory and CPU. There are two daemons running on the master and they are <b> NameNode </b> and Resource Manager. </p>
